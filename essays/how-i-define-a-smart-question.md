As an upcoming software developer, I'm bound to run into problems that I don't know the answer to immmediately. In many cases, the lazy way to solve the problem is to ask someone else to basically solve it for me. However, this is not a good approach considering it adds no value to the gain of solving a problem by going through the proper process of figuring a difficult problem. 

Eric Raymond provides in his essay, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way", specific guidelines to mitigate the easy trap to asking stupid questions. He explains that asking a smart question should include as many technical details as possible to make the individual attempting to answer the question the least amount of effort as possible. From my personal experience, I know the feeling of receiving a "stupid question" and also receiving a "smart question." The biggest difference I've noticed is that the individual asking the stupid question has done practically no research on his or her own and further proves a lack of attempt to solve the problem before asking a question. In this way, I agree with Raymond that as a person who could potentially solve the person's problem, it almost makes me feel like I'm handing away a free answer to someone who truly doesn't appreciate it. 

In order to give some examples, Stack Overflow provides "Top Questions" that people ask in order to solve their problems.
