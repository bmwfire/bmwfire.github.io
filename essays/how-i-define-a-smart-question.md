As an upcoming software developer, I'm bound to run into problems that I don't know the answer to immmediately. In many cases, the lazy way to solve the problem is to ask someone else to basically solve it for me. However, this is a non-optimal approach considering it adds no value to the gain of solving a problem by going through the proper problem solving process. 

Eric Raymond provides in his essay, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way", specific guidelines to mitigate the easy trap to asking stupid questions. He explains that asking a smart question should include as many technical details as possible to make the individual attempting to answer the question, the least amount of effort as possible. From my personal experience, I know the feeling of receiving a "stupid question" and also receiving a "smart question." The biggest difference I've noticed is that the individual asking the stupid question has done practically no research on his or her own and further proves a lack of attempt to solve the problem before asking a question. In this way, I agree with Raymond that as a person who could potentially solve the person's problem, it almost makes me feel like I'm handing away a free answer to someone who truly doesn't appreciate it. 

In order to give some examples, Stack Overflow provides "Top Questions" that people ask in order to solve their problems. Here, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52616918/in-vscode-how-to-properly-configure-jsconfig-json-in-order-for-absolute-paths-wi">SmartQuestion</a> asks the question "In VSCode how to properly configure jsconfig.json in order for absolute paths with index.js imports to work?" The reason this is considerably a smart question is because it gives a straight forward question that allows the person to understand how they could solve the problem. Further reading through the individual's question, it is very evident that the person tried his or her best to solve the problem on their own. In fact, the response to the solution to the problem was a simple fix further proving that the individual who asked the question was close to the solution. 

In contrast to the Smart Question above, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54352751/is-there-a-way-to-exclude-file-patterns-from-jest">StupidQuestion</a> simply asks "Is there a way to exclude file patterns from jest?" Reading through the content of the question, it is quite evident that the user made very little effort in an attempt to solve their problem and simply wants someone on Stack Overflow to answer the question for them. Personally, I understand the feeling of solving a "lazy" person's question. Given that I've been a teaching assistant, I've answered stupid questions that easily could have been solved had the person put the time in to solve it themselves. It seems as though the person took one look at the problem, and immediately asked for help without even trying to attempt it. 

By analyzing both examples of a smart and stupid question, it can easily allow an initial judgment of the person's intellectual capacity. I will take it a step further in the sense where a stupid question not only shows the person is possibly incompetent of solving a complex problem, but in my opinion, it gives a conclusion that the individual is extremely lazy. On the contrary, a smart question triggers me to help the individual. From what I've seen in my experiences, if somebody takes the time to write out a smart question, they will either figure out the problem on their own or will result in a tiny bug they seemed to have overlooked after staring at their problem for many hours. Personally, this is the kind of person I would want to help.

This concept of asking smart questions is not something new to me. Over the years, different people have taught me the value of asking smart questions. Not only does it allow me to sounds smarter as a software engineer, but asking smart questions ultimately gives me a chance to solve the problem on my own without having to disturb someone else for the solution. Somebody once told me this, "Even if I can't solve the problem, if I honestly put the effort in to attempt it, my question will exponentially be better in quality than if I didn't attempt it at all." This has been a key quote that has lived in my subconscious for many years.
