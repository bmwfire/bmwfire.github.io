In the recent years, the innovative development of software has changed the world dramatically. As someone who grew up during the area of software innovation, I remember in the day when there was no iPhone or the best that we had was a Desktop computer with simple functionalities. The world has changed so much in the last decade, and much of it can be contributed from software engineers coming up with new ways to make the world a better place. 

Despite all the good that has happened, there have also been areas where people simply felt the need to work in an unethical way. As an individual who just wants to be part of a movement of innovation, it confuses me that some people would be selfish enough to take advantage of loopholes. This is where ethics in any field, especially software engineering comes into critical play. 

I believe ethics, in the context of software engineering, looks like presenting your work in the best possible way. In the ACM Code of Ethics, "Professional Responsibilities 2.1" states that software engineers must strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work. Clearly stated, I believe one aspect of ethics looks like designing, implementing, and developing any software product with the intention that it will be high quality to contribute to the betterment of society.
