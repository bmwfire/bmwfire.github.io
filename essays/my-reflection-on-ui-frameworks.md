I recall years ago, when I was a tiny elementary student. I thought HTML was one of the coolest things I've ever seen; especially since I could program on any computer given I was using the standard Notepad as my editor. The different "projects" I completed were nothing short from simple webpages that linked to other pages. Nevertheless, I was very proud, as a little kid, that I knew how to develop HTML webpages. Sadly, that ambition to develop HTML pages started to fall away as life got busier, and I began focusing my mind on other things. 

It has been nearly 12 years since that time I used to obsess about writing a new webpage every time I saw a computer. Given that I've been in the study of Computer Engineering during my time in university, there was never a reason to get back into web development until my Software Engineering class. I remember as I was going through the necessary tutorials on HTML/CSS, it truly brought back memories to that kid 12 years ago developing simple webpages. We were then introduced to UI Frameworks, and I was quite fascinated with it considering all I knew how to do was create simple, old-style webpages.
